        Population Struct:
        -----------------
        Represents a population consisting of multiple individuals, 
        with associated feature metadata.

        Fields:
        - individuals: Vec<Individual>
            A vector containing the individuals in the population. 
            Each individual represents an entity with a set of attributes or features.

        - feature_names: HashMap<u32, String>
            A map between feature indices (u32) and their corresponding names (String).
            This provides a human-readable label for each feature in the population.
